# Morse Code Translator with JavaScript

## Instructions

- Valid English text input should start with an alphanumeric character
- Accepted input is [A-Za-z] [0-9] [. , ' ! ?]

## MVP

- Create a user interface that allows the user to either input some English text or some Morse Code
- Create JS functions that would allow the user to:

  - translate their English text into Morse Code
  - Morse Code into English text

- Make sure to handle spaces properly (ie. there is 1 space between English words, but one space between Morse Code characters)
- All non-DOM functions should have unit tests (use Jest)

## Bonus

Auto-detect the language - the app should auto-detect whether the input is in Morse code or English and translate to the opposite language
